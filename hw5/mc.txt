This program calculates pi using Monte Carlo Method. The program generates random points inside the assigned boundary. The area of the circle divided by the area of square is pi/4. Assuming that the number of points inside the circle is the area of circle and the number of points inside the square is the area of the sqaure, it calculates pi by doing 4*(number of points inside circle area)/(number of points inside square area).
